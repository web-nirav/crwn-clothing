- we need to install "node-sass" package to run the scss file

- We need to install "react-router-dom" to work with router and navigations in react 

- when using router, if we need router props in child component then we need to use "withRouter" component of react router dom which is higher order compoent which provides all url or router props directly to child component and we don't need to pass it down from parent component page 

- for any babel related error put this ins package.json file 
"resolutions": {
    "babel-jest": "24.7.1"
  },

  - We are using Firebase for authenticate and bit of storage

  - To use firebase we have to install firebase package into our application and also need to sign up and sign in to firebase site and create new proejct  

firebase project name 
  crwn-clothing

  crwn-db = app name 
  <!-- The core Firebase JS SDK is always required and must be listed first -->
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/6.3.4/firebase-app.js"></script>

<!-- TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
     https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#config-web-app -->

<script>
  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyDs7zutgsZyPhYoD7ALhBCUb9UHYeeEufI",
    authDomain: "crwn-clothing-53f47.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://crwn-clothing-53f47.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "crwn-clothing-53f47",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "245082220964",
    appId: "1:245082220964:web:a3c4aad33394e04b"
  };
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
</script>

sign in forms and firebase settings code required to integrate 

84. Google Sign In Authentication 3

next needs to work on App.js and firebase utitlity js file 

then we gonna work on sign up component and then apply sign up style 

after that we have to bring sign up compoenent into main component 

implemented firebase utils 

LOOK BACK FROM HERE TO REVIEW SOME OF REACT CONCEPTS VIDEO AND SOME OF FIREBASE CONCEPTS VIDEOS
BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO REDUX review the code from start to firebase 




REDUX 
- is the library that makes the state management easier not only for react but any tools that we use 

  WHY 
  - Good for Managing large state 
  - USerful for sharing data between Components/Containers
  - Predictable state management using the 3 principle 
    1. Single source of truth
      2. State is read only
        3. Changes using pure function 

          middleware
  ACTION     -->     ROOT REDUCER --> STORE --> DOM CHANGES

  FLUX PATTERN

  ACTION --> DISPATCHER --> STORE --> VIEW 
  HAving an action and dispatcher which dispatches this action to the store which is our state which updates our view, one way data flow 
  FLUX PATTERN - UNIDIRECTIONAL DATA FLOW 

  REDUX === this.state [React]

$ npm install redux redux-logger react-redux [we need these 3 library]

98 setting up redux 1 [can be watched again to understand strcuture of redux set up]

connect()() is higer order component that gets either one of those 2 functions 
its gonna work like, (connect())() so here we are  connecting response of first connect call to second ()

// from index.js, wrap our enire application with Provider so that we can pass store object and can use it throuhout our application 
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

// from root-rducer.js file to combine all of our application reducers 
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

// from store.js to create store object, to apply middleware and imported logger middleware
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import logger from "redux-logger";

// to connect our App with redux store so that we can fetch state and update the state 
import { connect } from "react-redux";

lession-13
- modification so that if user is logged in they should not be able to access signupsignin component 
- UserAction types file 

lession-14
- setting up cart  component and adding it to header component style and log 
- Cart dropdown component and place it in header 
- setting up reducer action to hide show cart dropdown 

continue from 107 

lession 15
- add to cart styling cusstom button style 
- add button to collection item and change style of it 
- cart item reducer 

lession 16 
- adding item to cart and also adding utility function to add item to cartitems array and increase quantity property 

-STEPS to follow for any action-reducer functionality
  start with reducer by defining initial state and then checking type of action and return value
  then go to define type and define action function 
  then go to compoenent and apply mapStateToProps or mapDispatchToProps 

  lession 17 
  - create cart item component for our cart and connect cart component to cart reducer 

lession 18
started from 112 

113 add reselect library 
npm i reselect

updating our application with reselect replaced cart selector 

lesson 19 

user selector 

116 
0, false, undefined, null, NaN, "" evaluates to false 
condition to cart drop down to show message and checkout button click redirect 

117 


120
added checkout page, checkout item component and updated cart to use selectors from reselect

selectors using reselect package is like using accessors/getters 

lession 20 21 22
remove itesm from cart and checkout page 

123 - 124 Redux Persist
  npm i redux-persist 
 
 setting up redux persistor and some configuration so that we can locally store data using this library so that we don't have to manually do it everytime

 125 126 127 
 here we are just moving Directory state, Collection state to redux so that at the time of testing it can be helpful and its pratice of overall flow 
and at the end we just create new collection overview compoenent for our next lessons of advance routing because now we will use our shop page to have route landing code 

Data Normalization => storing the list of items in an object instead of an array called data normalization because it make searching faster by dyrectly accessing object element using its key 

Section 13: Master Project: Stripe Payments Part 1
from 136 to 139 
for it we have to just install package as below,
$> npm i react-stripe-checkout 

Section 13: Master Project: Deploying to Production 
from 140 to 144 

$> heroku --version
$> heroku login [provide login credentials]
$> heroku create [PROJECT_NAME] --buildpack https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
$> git push heroku master
$> 
$>
