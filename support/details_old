Posted Sales Invoice Header will appear in change log as entries for Table_No 112. 
Posted Sales Invoice Line will appear in change log as entries for Table_No 113.
Both activated in test and I have posted two sales invoices.
Sales Return you do already have info about, right? 
The headers appear in Table_No = 36 and the lines in Table_No = 37.


I would like you to add authentication to the site. https://sync-center.cykelkraft.se/ is public for everyone knowing the url so we need users to login to protect our data.



One thing that I think should be done is to separate the import of SalesOrderHeaders and SalesOrderLines. Why? Let's play with the example that order "WS123" are created. That will create change log entries for Table_No = 36, but also for Table_No = 37. If we based on change on Table_No = 36 imports both SalesOrderHeaders and SalesOrderLines, we will import SalesOrderLines both when syncing Table_No = 36 and Table_No = 37.

Do you agree? 
Also, a change in the table 37 does not imply that there is a change in table 36 and the other way around.







Task List

3 new imports
"import:posted_sales_invoice_header" 
"import:posted_sales_invoice_line" 
"import:sales_return_line" 

then use 
table no 112  posted_sales_invoice_header, 
         113  posted_sales_invoice_line
          37  sales_return_line with document type similar to sales order line

PostedSalesInvoiceHeaders: 'No' is the key to search for.
PostedSalesInvoiceLines: Document_No shall be searched for. It seems to return an array of lines per Document_No.
SalesReturnLines: Use where('MYORDERNO', 'Document_No')
it will return all lines for MYORDERNO

No in table 112 corresponds to Document_No in table 113




So about next thing:

Now you are finishing the work with artisan sync:delta.
We alse need a command artisan sync:full that can be used for each table/model
For a start, we need to set up full sync and delta sync for these table/models:

SalesOrders(Headers)
SalesOrderLines
PostedSalesInvoices(Headers)
PostedSalesInvoiceLines
SalesReturnLines

DeltaSyncPostedSalesInvoices
DeltaSyncPostedSalesInvoiceLines
DeltaSyncSalesReturnLines

Also, the work you did for cockpit (fetch all orders that have a given sku in it) shall fetch data from sync-center API instead of NAV-API.


On SalesOrderLines the Document_No and Line_No in combination is unique.

DeltaSyncLog

sync-delta with class name changes with table name and class name and transfer specific table/model logic to its own file and call function for it

then create new sync-full







For the delta sync
1. make an artisan command retrieve new change log entries from NAV api and store these entries in table change_log_entries in local database

2. make an artisan command with "page" as a parameter, and for each page translate from the change_log_entries what needs to be done to get that page in sync. When an entry in the table change_log_entries have been processed and the page has been synced: set the is_synced = true
>> you mean in command if we pass, page=


- Do we have to check for any unique field as if same command will run more than once then it will make duplicate change log entries
- For Type_of_Change = Modification, we sometimes don'e get values for Old_Value and Old_Value_Local fields

CLIENT REPORT
- Work on api work to fetch data from NAV api to new sync center repo, discuss with client about requirement and related queries
- Worked on delta-sync functionality for importing change log data - Started working delta-sync for updating sales order and sales order line based on change log data in local, Discuss with client about queries
- Work on Sync center import and sync change log for sales order and related sales order lines, Also Did some correction based on client suggestion in sync functionality

Task List

- create a command to fetch and load data to local database
- create a simple form to accept SKU number to search products from DB


On SalesOrder header:

No = order_id
Bill_to_customer_No = customer_id
Bill_to_customer_Name = customer_name
Bill_to_Address = customer_address
Bill_to_Post_Code = customer_post_code
Bill_to_City = customer_city
Order_Date = order_date
Shipment_Date = shipment_date
Completely_Reserved = completely_reserved
Contains_Bike = contains_bike
Status = status (edited)


On SalesOrder lines:

Type = type
No = sku
Description = description
Location_Code = location
Quantity = qty
Reserved_Quantity = reserved_qty
Quantity_Shipped = shipped_qty
Shipment_Date = shipment_date (edited)



Queries
- what are the possible order status values?, for example one is "Open"
- what are the possible product Type values?, for example one is "Resource"


ok one Type value is "_blank_" so should i consider it as empty or i have make entry as this value "_blank_" <-- it should be null
what are the possible order status values?, for example one is "Open"
- what are the possible product Type values?, for example one is "Resource" <-- just use what the API gives you, but lowercase it (Resource = resource)

for orders, order_id is the unique key
and during import, please make sure that if we UPDATE the old version if we find one that already exist. I.e don't skip it, because it might have changed
update = including order lines

for orders we can update as we have unique key that is order_id

but we may not update order lines as we don't have unique key for that so i think I may delete order lines if I find existing order_id and make new entries for it



12 Feb 2019

- list customers, with pagging sorting, filtering like magento grid like victor gave,

23 Apr
	- Estimation of HCG - Admin feature listing - 1
	- Discuss new point of order sync functionality with Victor 

	Here is the idea to sync the order data,
	Whenever the event is fired from front end based on the topic value received on our broker end point, the registered listener will call and placed in queue 
	whenever the queue is processed then the data we get from request will be used to send to dotmailer api to sync the data or order 
	now here we have two options 
	1, call add order data 
	2, update order data 
	Let me know that if the order data can be available in dotmailer server then we have to send update request only
	if not then we have to check if order is exist then we have to use add order data end point 

	so let me know, what will be the case of add or edit end point? 

24 Apr
	- Estimation of HCG - Admin hours and api hours 2
	- Record fund email sending functionalty with server deployment 2 hours 
	- reviewing dotmailer documentation for order sync function set up in postman 

25 Apr
	- 2 Hour review book selling app features, discussing and explain to developer about it 
	- 1 hour for record fund db entry
	- Discuss one change

26 Apr
  - 2 Reviewing book selling app docs and planning on it 





lets say for example 
1)  {{var order.getCustomerName()}}
2)  {{var order.increment_id}} 
3)  {{var order.getCreatedAtFormated(‘long’)}}
4)  {{var payment_html}} 
5)  {{var order.getShippingDescription()}} 
6)  {{var order.getShippingAddress().getName()}}
7)  {{var order.getShippingAddress().getStreet1()}}
8)  {{var order.getShippingAddress().getPostcode()}}
9)  {{var order.getShippingAddress().getCity()}}
10) {{var order.getShippingAddress().getCountryModel().getName()}}
11) {{var order.getShippingAddress().getTelephone()}}<
12) {{Var order.getShipmentDate()}} 
13) {{layout handle="sales_email_order_items" order=$order}}  
-- order item line list - list of orderred items in one order with name.sku,qty,price etc.
14) {{var customer.email}}

1) $_item->getName()
2) $_item->getDescription() >> like if configurable product add bike size or configurable attribute and it' selection in order
3) $this->getSku($_item); >> getSku
4) $_item->getQtyOrdered();
5) $_item->getRowTotal()

07 May 
- First we will create one end point on broker repo 
- from that end point we will accept event and based on mapping listener will called 
- in that listner, we will accept Address book id and email address to be added 
- Then we will take those data and call dot mailer api to add email to given address book
- For cokpit repo, under customer section we will give one button to unsubscribe from news letter 
- from that form admin can add email address to unsubscribe 
- we will use same api we will create on broker repo to add email address to unsubscribe address book 

Let me know about this development plan, If all good then I will implement it

08 May
- R&D to find dotmailer api to fetch address book from email address but didn't find 
instead found api to get address books based on contact id 

09 May 
Hi for adding email to "Subscribers" address bookId will create direct end point or it will be also on some event?
you need to create direct endpoint, totally isolated code so we can send it to front end team

yes, because if contact was previously in unsubscribe address book and then suddenly wants to subscribe - we need to remove contact from unsubscribe as this is the last rule.

10 May 

We have a POS system called Sitoo in our stores. POS means Point Of Sales and is the application we use at the checkout registrars in the stores.
Sitoo will call URL https://sync-center.cykelkraft.se/sitoo/contacts with different contents depending on the action

1. GET "https://sync-center.cykelkraft.se/sitoo/contacts?key=<email OR phone number>" - fetch customer by email or phone number and respond with only one customer if found.

2. GET "https://sync-center.cykelkraft.se/sitoo/contacts/<contact_id>" - get customer by contact id

3. POST "https://sync-center.cykelkraft.se/sitoo/contacts/" - add new customer

4. PUT "https://sync-center.cykelkraft.se/sitoo/contacts/<contact_id>" - update existing customer

so first setup this endpoint in sync center and once that's done we will add dummydata and respond with json arrays. once concept is working we will connect storm customer api and add real data.


11 May 
	finding contact id using one api and then delete it from unsubscribed address book

12 May 

16 May 
- discuss the new changes done by client and working on new api end points for broker repo for front end team to use to add email to dotmailer address book
- subscribe and unsubscribe end points on broker repo for front end guys 
- after done need to update to trello and work on next card 


	Cockpit repo checkbox logic 
	- first we will find id of given email address and using id we will find the address book of it 
	- we will check that address book id should be of subscribed address book's id then we will show checked checkbox if not then unchecked 
	- when user submit the form, 
		- if checkbox is selected, then we will call subscribe api of broker repo 
		- else we will call unsubscribe api of broker repo 

	finished with all above tasks and updated to client

17 May 
	- 1.5 H testing bookselling apis and provide suggestions

	- Changes of broker newsletter api end point and applying passport authentication

	also now i realize there's a function in RecordController.php named syncTemplates - this should also be removed. only record event should be used
>> For this which event I have to use and listener name please?

	- changes of response message based on the event and also changes of removing direct end point and placing event listener for subscribe and unsubscribe 
	- similar for sync template  
	- validating events and email 
	

22 May 

	- discussing and doing changes of keeping same method for all events which is record and making listener call and test it on live 

23 May 
	- Discuss the functionality of dotmailer to be moved to sync center from each api call for each handle method 

so for each handle method of broker event listener I will create new end point on sync center and new method for each end point right?

for example,
DotMailerNewsletterSubscribe -> handle method -> will call sync center end point "subscribe" => DotmailerController -> subscribe
DotMailerNewsletterUnsubscribe -> handle method -> will call sync center end point "unsubscribe" => DotmailerController -> unsubscribe
DoMailerSyncTemplates -> handle method -> will call sync center end point "sync-template" => DotmailerController -> syncTemplate

	transfering dotmailer functionality from broker to sync center 

24 May 

- Working on moving functionality of dot mailer from broker repo to sync center repo 
- Test functionality on local and also on live         





	Working on some advance concepts using example set up like eloquent collection methods like map, filter, random, shuffle, prepend, chunk etc...

- Need to find the way to automatically download the mail templates and store them in broker repo 
	- Need to refresh all template in broker repo 
	- Create one button(fetch changes from dot mailer) in cockpit which when click will call broker repo and then in turn broker repo will call dot mailer api and fetch all templates and store it to templates table 
		- But here the issue is the place holder are replaced manually so those needs to be managed from dot mailer side when tempalte is created or updated?

	- Broker repo api end point, sync-templates with topic=sync.templates request parameter 
	- create an event in broker repo, "sync.templates" with listener "DotMailerSyncTemplate" which when triggered the listener's handle method will 
	- in listeners handle method, first we will empty out all templates from table
	- then we will call dotmailer api which will fetch and store all the templates 

	first of all we have to change our templates table to add new template id field 
	On Broker repo,
	- First of all we can implement one function to refresh the templates table in broker repo
		- In refresh process, we can first delete all templates from table and
		- call and fetch dotmailer templates api and store them in table
	- we will set up one end point which when hit we will call this function 
	
	On Cockpit repo,
	- For daily auto update, we can create one command which we can schedule to run daily mid night at some time and which will call broker api 
	- For manual update, we can provide button in admin which when clicked we can call same api 

	So, this way with different event we can call same api to update templates
